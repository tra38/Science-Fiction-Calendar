# Science-Fiction-Calendar
Will generate information about a planet's calendar system based on astronomical data.

Can also be used for fantasy settings as well.

# Current Status
The calcuator is composed of several files that can:
*Determines how many hours are in a planet's year (can accept Earth or Planet units)
*Determine how many minutes are in a planet's decade (can accept Earth or Planet units)
*Convert from Earth day/hour units to Planet day/hour units
*Create a semi-functioning calendar system (only accepts Planet units)

I do plan on expanding the calendar system to produce something a little bit more nicer (such as names for the generated months/seasons) and handle leap days better.
