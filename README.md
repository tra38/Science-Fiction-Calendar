# Science-Fiction-Calendar
Will generate information about a planet's calendar system based on astronomical data.

Can also be used for fantasy settings as well.

# Current Status
Right now, the calculator just determines how many hours are in a planet's year, and how many minutes are in
a planet's decade. But I will plan on expanding it from there to produce some more useful data.
